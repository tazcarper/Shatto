              <p class="question">How are the cows cared for?</p>
              <p class="answer">The cows are milked daily and receive personal attention to make sure that their health is maintained. Personal records are kept on each cow and calf to assure growth and development proceeds as normal. A local veterinarian is used whenever preventative health measures are required as well as checking in for any unexpected situations. They have covered shelter to rest or sleep and are provided a grazing area for their pleasure and comfort.</p>
